var x = 10; 

//the keyword "var" is used to declare a vatiable (in this case simply named "x" and it's value is 10)
//the "=" is called Asignment opeator. and it's function is to asign the value in it's right to the value in it's left.

document.write(x); 

//Variables can be printed in an html.

//variables are case sensitive, so if we tried to print "X" we wouldn't get any output as X it's a different variable from x.

//variable names should start with either a letter or an undescore
//i.e : var _counter = "hi"
//      var counter = 10
//variable names can't contain special characters such as # or %
//Variables can't be named as any reserved word, however the names can contain them
//i.e : var else123 = 10 
var else123 = 10;

document.write("<br>" + else123); // the plus sign in this case represents a concatenation
