//comparison operators are usefull in 
//conditional sentences (ifs)
var num = 3;
var bool = (num == 3); //if we were to print bool (and we will) it would return true
document.write(bool);
var otherbool = (num == 4); //this will return false
document.write("<br>" + otherbool);
//the == operator verifies if the value to the right is equal to the value in the left
//there are several operators such as != (not equals), === (strictly equals), < (smaller than), <=(smaller or equal)
