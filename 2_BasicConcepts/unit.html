    <h1>BASIC CONCEPTS</h1>
    <!--We'll be using this html to show all of the js scripts of this unit-->
    
    <h2>1.- Variables</h2>
    <p>Here, we assign the numeric value of 10 to a variable called "x" and then we show it's value<br>
    the second row it's only to demonstrate that a variable can contain the name of a reserved word but only if it is altered with some character it's following it or preceding it</p>
