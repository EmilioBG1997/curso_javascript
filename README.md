# curso_javascript
Files used during my javascript learning process.

## Description
In this repository I'll be pushing all the files that I'll be using to learn the basics of Javascript.  
I'll also be writting everything in English so I can use this course for both English practicing and Javascript learning.  

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repo for your personal use. Every important part is commented in order to explain what everything does.  
I won't be accepting any pull request because of the nature of this "project", however, you can request them anyway and I'll happily take a look at your ideas.
